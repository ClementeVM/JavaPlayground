This repository is to add small projects that I used to learn. The idea is to keep all these simple projects together in one place and to have a space where to add simple projects that I consider interesting.

### Calculator:
Basic calculator where you can add, subtract, multiply and divide.

### Password Generator:
Application where you can create a password with all the requirements you need. You can customize the password in the length (from 4 to 24), type of charaters (Lower or Upper letters, Numbers and/or Symbols; and getting at the same time the strength of the password once created. You can also see and hide the passowrd, copy it to clipboard and regenerate a new one if you want so.
